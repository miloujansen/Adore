            <h3>Vision on Design</h3>
            <h4>When I observe the society I am an inseparable part of, I find it impossible to paint an objective 
                picture. My vision for design is rooted in the belief that it covers every facet of our existence. And 
                that <b>design serve as embodied expressions of our collective Soul</b> that reveal the universal laws 
                of life
            <h4>
                I see <b>design as a powerful tool to foster deeper understanding and connection—both within 
                ourselves and with the world around us. </b> By focusing on the nuances and subjectivities that 
                define our human experience, design can initiate real transformation. For me, design holds the 
                potential to bridge gaps, dissolve polarizations, and cultivate a more <b>harmonious and 
                compassionate society.</b> I advocate for a <b>balanced worldview </b> that recognizes both the challenges 
                and the possibilities of our future, advocating for holistic approaches, global collaboration, and 
                ethical technological advancements
            </h4>
                <h4>I believe that design should inspire us to <b> harmonize body, mind, and spirit,</b> encouraging a reconciliation with our humanity. 
                <i>Are we calm, courageous and wise enough to surrender to our to the unknown? </i> Technology, when used thoughtfully, can be a means to this end, helping us to <b>reconcile with our human nature rather than alienate us from it. </b> Inspired by intercultural philosophies, I envision a world where design prompts us to pause, reflect, and engage with profound questions about our existence and our future. 
                </h4>
                <h4>Ultimately, my goal is to <b>design joyfull experiences that serve as invitations for self-discovery and collective growth, </b> fostering a sense of fulfillment and well-being in an ever-evolving world.
                </p>
        </div>

            <h3>Professional Identity</h3>
            <h4> I think of myself as an <b> Artistic Design Researcher </b> with a solid foundation in design theory and practice. </h4>
            <h4> I am pursuing a master degree in <b>Industrial Design </b> at the Eindhoven University of Technology, and 
                I hold a bachelor degree in <b>Industrial Design Engineering </b> from the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. </h4>
            <h4> My professional and educational background allowed me to develop a diverse skill set and a <b> broad perspective on design, </b> 
                demonstrating my ability to work within different contexts and with various people. 
                It also shows how <b> my practice has evolved </b> from stakeholder-driven and product-driven projects
                <b>to more conceptual and speculative designs,</b> reflecting a <b> deep interest in well-being</b> and the <b> ethical implications of technology.</b>
            </h4>
            <h4> My Research through Design approach, often described as <b>'poetic,</b> is characterized by an 
                <b>explorative attitude </b> where I get inspired by diverse philosophies and materials. I use my 
sensitivity, focus, child-like openness, technical insight, and practical skills to bring my ideas to life. This 
method allows me to reflect on emerging technologies and create <b>physical, interactive</b> and <b> intelligent research probes </b> that are both aesthetically and conceptually engaging.

                       I would like to invite people to pause and contemplate philosophical questions through embodied experiences. 
                        These questions could be about ontology, shifting perspectives, and religion.

    <h3>General Reflection on Experiences and Education</h3>
    <div class="two-columns">
            <div class="column">
            <h4>My experiences at Vetus, where I developed various boating parts, required collaboration across 
                various disciplines and cultures, focusing strongly on technology and realization. My time at 
                Philips Research, where I designed a medical device for spinal fusion surgery. involved working on 
                cutting-edge technologies in real-life contexts, providing insights into user interactions and 
                aesthetic dimensions. Both experiences equipped me with practical product design skills and 
                experience of working in the field
            </h4>

            <h4>After some time of working I was eager to learn more, gain international experience, work on 
societal projects, and explore the "why" rather than the "how" or "what </h4>

<h4>I didn't fully know what I signed up for when I ambitiously applied for the Industrial Design pre-master program. Luckily, I immediately felt I had made the right decision. The first course I 
    followed was "Design for Debate", which set the tone for an incredible intellectual and personal 
    journey in domain of speculative design</h4>

    <h4>My recent internship in Stockholm, at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden allowed me to live 
        abroad, learn about new cultures, work in a consortium of individuals with different expertise, and 
        taught me to put design research methodologies into practice. During my internship I delved 
        deeper into the concepts of digital ethics through the lens of slowness, intimacy, and 
        compassion, areas of research that are often overlooked within international organizations I’ve 
        been involved with, but have been recognized as significant elements for the workforce. As such, 
        this experience contributed to acknowledging the relevance of my interest in the actuality of a 
        business organization</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <h4>Additionally, during my master’s, I started working as a tree worker, caring whole bodily for the 
                green environment around us. This experience profoundly transformed my relationship with 
                materials and my perspective on innovation. It invited me to contemplate the value of maintenance 
                and care</h4>
    
                <h4>Reflecting on my Master’s program at TU/e, I noticed how I gradually adapted to the demands of 
                    academia, which were initially quite new to me. Unexpectedly, it became a period to explore my 
                    fascination with moral emotions and the richness of (human-computer) interaction</h4>
    
                    <h4>I got particularly enthusiastic about examining how artificial agents influence moral emotions 
                        such as compassion, gratitude, and awe, aligning with my passion for exploring how technology 
                        can enhance well-being and cultivate positive emotional development. This interest is exemplified 
                        in my Final Master Project, "Adore: An Opening to Contemplation," which builds on your theory of 
                        Interactional Morality and aims to learn more about the influence of embodiment.</h4>
    
                    <h4><b>The common thread I noticed, is that through the lens of well-being I have gradually narrowed my focus on meaningmaking, 
                        morality, ethics, spatial design and embodiment</b></h4>

            <div class="column">
                <h3>Creativity & Aesthetics</h3>
                <h4>For me, this creativity involves handling the resources available, and embracing design as a 
                    process of discovery, using creativity techniques and changing perspectives to generate and 
                    refine ideas. The main take away of my studies is balancing intuition and knowledge, and the 
                    learing about multiple layers of aesthetics. I learned the value of iterative analysis and design 
                    narratives, to illustrate my process

            <h3>Business & Entrepreneurship</h3>
            <h4>Initially, I took courses to study business models because I noticed the significant influence of the 
                business world on society. Înderstanding this influence is valuable, and I explored the role of a 
                designer in this context, focusing on potential, promises, and ideas. </h4>

            <h4>My focus has shifted from individual users to broader societal contexts, integrating psychological 
                and sociological insights for impactful design. I've delved into postmodern theories, drawing 
                inspiration from scholars like Donna Haraway, Rosi Braidotti, Ron Wakkary, Minha Lee. I explored 
                walking practices, posthuman feminism, and the ethics of care, slowness and the concept of 
                Design Justice and Intercutural philosophy. Influences also include Renate Schepen, Sophie 
                Oluwole, Byung-Chul Han, Slavoj Žižek, Carl Jung, Mark Fisher. </h4>
                <h4>My readings on philosophy, 
                religion, morality, and politics, combined with personal experiences, during this master made me 
                committed to keeping debates open and embrace the complexity, believing balance and openness 
                will lead to connection. I've learned quantitative and qualitative research methods to empathize 
                with stakeholders and address cultural, political, and social implications. I consider the theories 
                I've studied to be the most significant gain from my studies. </h4>

            However, documenting this richness of data and insights remains challenging for me. Despite this, 
            I have developed skills in academic knowledge and effectively framing design research.</h4>

    <h3>Critical Note</h3>
    <h4>Reflecting on my working ethics, poetic sometimes hinges more towards chaotic. I noticed how hard I find it to expres myself freely and 
        clearly, making it a real challenge to submit my work on time. It often fails to fully capture the 
        intensity and completeness of my ideas. I feel I am still learning and that my process is gaining 
        more structure each time, yet I believe I am only at the start of my learning curve. I am motivating 
        me to continue improving and refining my approach.Embodied practices help me to structure my mind.
