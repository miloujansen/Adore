<section>
    <p>Hi, My name is Milou. I am an artist, educated in engineering and design research. I balance the precision of engineering and research methods, with boundlesness feeling of artistic expression and creativity of designerly practices.  </p>
    <p>I am deeply interested in the relationship between people and things (e.g. objects, products, artifacts). I am interested in how the interaction between human and non-human things influences well-being from individual to collective scale.</p>
    <p> During my masters in Industrial Design, I got engouraged to explore my fasicnations, and became more and more interested in the way people navigate complexity and aesthetics and ethics of artificial intelligence. 
        For my final master porject, I now narrowed my focus on the themes: interactivity, embodiment and morality. 
        <p><b>I contemplate questions such as:</b>
        <p><i><li>If technology is an extension of who we are and design a mediator of our experiences, how can we play with the role it takes in shaping our lives?</p>
        <p><li> What does it mean to live a good life in today's society?</p>
        <p><li>What does it mean for humanity to live with technology consciously, in harmony, as a means, not as an end? 
            </i></p>
    <p>To gain more insights in these themes, I follow a Research-through-Design (RtD) process.  
    The way I work has been describes as 'poetic'. It is characterized by an exploratory approach where I let myself be inspired by divers philosophies and materials. Using my sensitivity, child-like opennes, technical insight, and practical skills to physicalize my thinking.
    This way of working allows me to reflect on emerging technologies, and to create research probes that are both aesthetically and conceptually engaging. </p>
                    
        <p><b>Design Stategies and Vision</b>
            <li><i>Exploring Well-being through Design</i> </p>
            <ul>Through interaction with objects, products, and artifacts, we can learn what it means to live a good life. 
                I believe that curiosity about our own actions and attitudes is the first step in better understanding our place in the world. 
                By cultivating awareness of these dynamics, we can create designs that enhance our well-being. 
                </ul>
            <li><i>Interactive Installations for Reflection</i>
                <ul>Designing installations that actively engage users, could encourage them to reflect on their own experiences and perceptions. 
                I am passionate about designing interactive installations that invite users to pause and contemplate philosophical questions through embodied experiences. 
                These questions could be about ontology, shifting perspectives, and religion. 
                My goal is to create spaces where individuals can explore these ideas, leading to greater self-awareness and a deeper understanding of their surroundings.</p>               
                </ul>
             <li><i></i>A New Perspective on Technology</li>
                <ul>
                Design could be used to raise awareness about the ethical and social implications of technology. 
                I advocate for a new attitude towards technology—one that empowers us to be more humane. One that shifts aways from efficiency driven technology. </li> 

                <p><b>Expertise Areas</b>

                        </ul>
       </body>
    </ul>
         
    <p>Through these strategies, design can be a tool to address human and more-than-human challenges. I envision spaces where designes are desiged as invitations, for people to gain a deeper understanding of themselves and their environment, ultimately contributing to a better and more fulfilling life.</p>
    Besides my efforts as a designer and researcher, I’m working as a tree worker, caring whole bodily for the green around us. I find joy in listening to and playing music, cooking for loved ones, engaging in sports, and expressing myself creatively through painting, writing, photography, and drawing.
